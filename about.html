      <h3>Academics</h3>
      <p>
        From August 2021 to May 2025, I attended Carnegie Mellon University, where 
        I studied Electrical and Computer Engineering, with an interest in autonomous, 
        robotic applications and real-time embedded systems. I also studied topics 
        in artificial intelligence, optimal control and reinforcement learning, and 
        conducted research in non-smooth dynamical systems during my Masters (in ECE), which
        I completed under the integrated masters-bachelors program of Carnegie Mellon.

          <h5>Get Involved</h5>
          <p>
            Get involved in something related to your academic interests immediately! Especially 
            if your at a mega-research institution like Carnegie Mellon, or really any school that
            hosts professionaly-targeted organizations like a robotics club, debate team, game design club, 
            or venture capital club. All of these organizations will not only be great for your resume as a
            growing professional, but they'll give you an idea of what your actual work can be like. Even more,
            your able to connect with individuals with the same or similar interests! You can find mentorship, 
            make connections, and probably find yourself taking on leadership roles, which can come with its
            own set of growth opportunities.

          <h5>Make Friends</h5>
          <p>
            If you want to "make friends" then make yourself open to making friends! 
            What do I mean by this. If you see that campus is hosting tons of club/social 
            events, especially during your freshman year, make an effort to go to them! 
            Even if you've already found 1 friend or 2, why stop there? I believe one of 
            the greatest skills to grow in college is networking, and although it might not 
            sound like it, but the overcoming of anxiety that it takes to even say "hi" to a 
            random person is the same difficulties you'll face during networking. Why do you 
            think the "social" people are usually great at netwroking? It's probably because 
            they have spent a great deal of time saying "hi" to random people, working through 
            conversations of various perspectives, and being able to connect with 
            them in a friendly manner. I'm not saying its easy, but you can make it easy. 
            Every time you step into another social event, it gets easier and easier, but you
            have to actively work at it.
